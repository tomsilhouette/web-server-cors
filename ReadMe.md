**Setting up the Web-proxy for the Silhouette Web App on your machine**

This web-proxy is used to allow access to the Silhouette America cloud which otherwise is not accessible to the web app directly.
Here is how you can install it on a machine:

1) Download and install Node.js (https://www.nodejs.org) - make sure all options are set

2) Open a terminal and git clone this repo into a folder called 'web-proxy';

```git clone git@codebasehq.com:silhouettesoftware/silhouette-suite/web-proxy.git```

3) cd into the web-proxy folder ```cd web-proxy```

4) enter ```npm intall```

**Running the web-proxy**

Enter 'npm start' to start the web-proxy

    Note: if the terminal window is closed, you will need to start npm to run the web-proxy again
